Site Demo: https://prakhar3125.netlify.app/

-This website was created using a no-code tool called Webflow, complemented by custom CSS and JavaScript code. Enhancements include a theme toggle, an animated gradient background, functional form integration using Google Forms as the backend, and the addition of new sections.

-For form functionality, the action URL and input field names from a Google Form were integrated into the code. This ensures that any details filled in the form on the website are stored directly in the Google Form.

-This code implements theme switching with smooth transitions and custom scrollbar styling. CSS variables centralize color control, making customization easy for light and dark themes. Smooth animations during theme changes are achieved with transition properties. Scrollbar styling is tailored for different themes using classes and variables. This approach enhances user experience with a cohesive interface and improved scrollbar interaction.
